Flexible content (Model instance) flagging for Django.

This is based on [Pinax Flagging](https://github.com/pinax/django-flag).
The goal is to extend it to support more flexible flagging.

Requirements:

 * Support developer-defined flagging 'reason' codes (such as 'spam', 'abuse', etc.)
 * Ability to query counts for flagged item and 'reason'.
